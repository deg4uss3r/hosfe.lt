# Hello! 

I am Ricky Hosfelt a career software engineer and now an Engineering Manager with a passion for Rust, Networking, and helping others. I hope to write more on all of the above plus some other random interests of mine (watches, hockey, cars, video games, etc) in the future. Thanks for stopping by :D
