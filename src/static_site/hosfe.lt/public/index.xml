      <description>From an early point in my career I have always wanted to lead. Not out of ego, but I have always loved helping others.&#xA;In high school I was part of a small company (woo Spearfish Industries, thanks Steve and Dave ;)) that helped local businesses with the internet, websites, graphic design, and videography. This was my entry into computer science and I absolutely loved it I went from the lead graphic designer to the network admin and started to really enjoy setting up routers and explaining the settings to grandmas and business owners alike.</description>
